# Arijit Portfolio - 3D Neon Starter

Vite + React + Tailwind + React-Three-Fiber starter with a tech-neon "data mesh" background.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Notes

- The 3D background uses @react-three/fiber and three.
- Tailwind is configured; if styles don't appear, ensure you have installed devDependencies and restarted the dev server.
